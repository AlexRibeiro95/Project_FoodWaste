### Project Context:

- The global food supply chain is a complex system that involves various stages from production to consumption. Each stage of the supply chain, including farming, processing, transportation, retail, and consumption, is associated with food loss and waste. This wastage not only represents a loss of valuable resources but also contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, impacting the environment and sustainability efforts.

### Introduction:

- This project aims to tackle the critical issue of food waste and emissions throughout the food supply chain. By addressing food waste, we can make significant strides in reducing environmental impact, conserving resources, improving food security and fighting worldwide hunger. Our aim is to identify critical stages in the food chain where interventions can significantly reduce waste and emissions, thereby enhancing sustainability practices within the industry.

  
- An in-depth analysis of food waste contributions to global emissions, exploring data across various countries and stages of the food supply chain. This project aims to provide actionable insights and encourage sustainable practices.



## Project Overview
This project utilizes Python and several libraries to analyze and visualize crucial stages of food supply that contribute significantly to emissions. We focus on the top 10 countries with the highest food-related emissions and provide comparative insights against global averages.
